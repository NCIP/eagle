Welcome to the EAGLE Project!
=====================================

Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) is a unique collaboration between the United State (NCI) and Italy (UNIMI).  It represents collaborative efforts of over 100 scientists, clinicians and support staff.  The study goals are to identify the genetic and environmental determinants of both lung cancer and smoking and to shed light on the determinants of therapy success and long term survival in patients diagnosed with lung cancer. The EAGLE group has completed data collection for a multi-center case-control study of lung cancer in the Lombardy Region of Italy; over 2000 cases and 2000 controls were enrolled between 2002 and 2005.

The EAGLE is an Open Source project and it is written in Java using Spring Framework, Hibernate, JSF, Apache Commons, caCORE CSM, caCORE CLM and Struts.
