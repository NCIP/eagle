	Environmental And Genetic Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) is an interdisciplinary multi-center case-control study of lung cancer conducted in Milan, Italy, designed to explore the genetic determinants both of lung cancer and smoking.  The study, initiated by the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), enrolled 2,000 incident lung cancer cases, including both males and females of Italian nationality, ages 35 to 79 years old, with verified lung cancer of any histological type.  In addition 2,000 healthy controls randomly selected from the catchment area and matched to cases by age, gender and residence are enrolled.  Extensive epidemiologic data, clinical data, blood and lung tissue paraffin blocks are collected, to enable investigation into the genetic factors that interact with smoking in the etiology of the disease as well as to identify the genetic determinants of therapy efficacy and survival in the lung cancer subjects.
